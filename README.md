# Support and contact details
In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist. The goal of data is insight and if you find insight that I didn't, do let me know.
